// These are implementations of a few algorithms, similar in nature to those in
// <algorithm>, but which are async-friendly in the sense that they yield
// periodically.
//
// For the simplest use cases we offer free functions like async_for_each, which
// is the same as for_each except that it yields every Traits::Interval
// iterations: every call starts the counter anew.
//
// For more complicated cases, like nested loops, it may be convenient to carry
// the counter from one iteration to the next, in order to yield at the correct
// times. For example, in a doubly nested loop where the inner loop always ran
// for less than Interval iterations, we would not yield with the simple
// functions.

/**
 * @brief Call f on every element, yielding occasionally and accepting
 * an externally provided counter for yield control.
 *
 * This is equivalent to std::for_each, except that the computational
 * loop yields every Traits::Interval (default 100) iterations in order
 * to avoid reactor stalls. The returned future resolves when all elements
 * have been processed.
 *
 * This behaves similarly to async_for_each except that the counter used to
 * track how much work as been done since the last attempted yield is passed
 * in by the caller. This allows use in more complex cases such as nested loops
 * where the inner loop may itself not do sufficient work to ever trigger the
 * yield condition, even though the total amount of work done across all
 iterations
 * is very high.
 *
 * Use case:
 *
 * Replace something like:
 *
 * for (... outer loop ...) {
 *   for (... inner loop ...) {
 *      f(elem);
 *   }
 * }
 * with:
 *
 * async_counter counter;
 * for (... outer loop ...) {
 *    async_for_each(counter, begin, end, f);
 * }
 *
 * The counter is taken by reference and must live at least until the
 * returned future resolves: this usually trivial when the caller is a
 * coroutine but may require some care when continuation style is used.
 *
 * The function is taken by value.
 *
 * The iterators must remain valid until the returned future resolves.
 *
 * @param begin the beginning of the range to process
 * @param end the end of the range to process
 * @param f the function to call on each element
 * @return ss::future<> a future which resolves when all elements have been
 * processed
