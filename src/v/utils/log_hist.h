/*
 * A histogram implementation
 * The buckets upper bounds are powers of 2 minus 1.
 * `first_bucket_upper_bound` therefore must be a power of 2.
 * The number of values represented by each bucket increases by powers 2 as
 * well.
 *
 * Assume `number_of_buckets` is 4 and `first_bucket_upper_bound` is 16 the
 * bucket value ranges are;
 *
 * [1, 16), [16, 32), [32, 64), [64, 128)
 *
 * And if 1, 16, 32, and 33 are recorded the buckets will have the following
 * counts;
 *
 * [1, 16)   = 1
 * [16, 32)  = 1
 * [32, 64)  = 2
 * [64, 128) = 0
